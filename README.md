This contains the code written and debugged with the help of two groups of UCSC SIP interns over summer 2022 and summer 2023, as well as all relevant files that  the code references. This was a collaborative effort and would have been impossible without the help of my SIP interns: Ishaan Agrawal, Riya Shah, Jessamine Qu (for summer 2022) and Theodore Cohen, Samik Garg, Andrew Liu (for summer 2023), my advisor Raja GuhaThakurta, and my 2022 co-mentor Kyle Nguyen. 

The .csv and .zip files contained in this project are all necesary for the code, in the "Trial
"TargetData.csv", "Quasars.csv"
